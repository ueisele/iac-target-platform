#
#       There are lots of options in this file.  All you have to have is a set
#       of nodes listed {"node ...} one of {serial, bcast, mcast, or ucast},
#       and a value for "auto_failback".
#
#       ATTENTION: As the configuration file is read line by line,
#                  THE ORDER OF DIRECTIVE MATTERS!
#
#       In particular, make sure that the udpport, serial baud rate
#       etc. are set before the heartbeat media are defined!
#       debug and log file directives go into effect when they
#       are encountered.
#
#       All will be fine if you keep them ordered as in this example.
#

#       A note on specifying "how long" times below...
#
#       The default time unit is seconds
#               10 means ten seconds
#
#       You can also specify them in milliseconds
#               1500ms means 1.5 seconds
#
#
#       keepalive: how long between heartbeats?
#
keepalive 2

#       deadtime: how long-to-declare-host-dead?
#
#               If you set this too low you will get the problematic
#               split-brain (or cluster partition) problem.
#               See the FAQ for how to use warntime to tune deadtime.
#
deadtime 10

#       warntime: how long before issuing "late heartbeat" warning?
#       See the FAQ for how to use warntime to tune deadtime.
#
warntime 5

#       Very first dead time (initdead)
#
#       On some machines/OSes, etc. the network takes a while to come up
#       and start working right after you've been rebooted.  As a result
#       we have a separate dead time for when things first come up.
#       It should be at least twice the normal dead time.
#
initdead 30

#       What UDP port to use for bcast/ucast communication?
#
udpport        694

#       Set up a unicast / udp heartbeat medium
#       ucast [dev] [peer-ip-addr]
#
#       [dev]           device to send/rcv heartbeats on
#       [peer-ip-addr]  IP address of peer to send packets to
#
{% for host in heartbeat_member_hosts %}
ucast {{ heartbeat_interface }} {{ host }}
{% endfor %}

#       auto_failback:  determines whether a resource will
#       automatically fail back to its "primary" node, or remain
#       on whatever node is serving it until that node fails, or
#       an administrator intervenes.
#
#       The possible values for auto_failback are:
#               on      - enable automatic failbacks
#               off     - disable automatic failbacks
#               legacy  - enable automatic failbacks in systems
#                       where all nodes do not yet support
#                       the auto_failback option.
#
#       auto_failback "on" and "off" are backwards compatible with the old
#               "nice_failback on" setting.
#
#       See the FAQ for information on how to convert
#               from "legacy" to "on" without a flash cut.
#               (i.e., using a "rolling upgrade" process)
#
#       The default value for auto_failback is "legacy", which
#       will issue a warning at startup.  So, make sure you put
#       an auto_failback directive in your ha.cf file.
#       (note: auto_failback can be any boolean or "legacy")
#
auto_failback on

#       Tell what machines are in the cluster
#       node    nodename ...    -- must match uname -n
node{% for host in heartbeat_member_hosts %} {{ host }}{% endfor %}

#       Treats heartbeat_virtual_ip as a psuedo-cluster-member
#       Used together with ipfail below...
#       note: don't use a cluster node as ping node
#
ping {{ heartbeat_virtual_ip }}

#       Note on logging:
#       If all of debugfile, logfile and logfacility are not defined,
#       logging is the same as use_logd yes. In other case, they are
#       respectively effective. if detering the logging to syslog,
#       logfacility must be "none".
#
#       Do we use logging daemon?
#       If logging daemon is used, logfile/debugfile/logfacility in this file
#       are not meaningful any longer. You should check the config file for logging
#       daemon (the default is /etc/logd.cf)
#       more infomartion can be fould in the man page.
#       Setting use_logd to "yes" is recommended
#
use_logd yes
